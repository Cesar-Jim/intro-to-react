### Questions

> In your own words, explain the React core concept of encapsulation. Discuss why this React principle is important in application development.

**A.**
React is pretty much all about components. An encapsulated component provides props and states to control its own behavior without exposing or making public its internal structure. In other words, while maintaining **private** its internal structure.

Issues like variable collisions, undesirable value assignments or other types of variable conflicts can be avoided thanks to encapsulation.

Some benefits of encapsulation are:

1. Changes can be made in one area of the app without affecting others
2. Any component can be replaced with an alternative implementation
3. Easier to reuse components across the app. This favors the DRY principle.
4. Components are easier to "unit-test"
5. Privacy of the internal structure or the implementation details
