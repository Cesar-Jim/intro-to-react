### Questions

> Peruse the Official React documentation by Facebook, note down anything interesting you find and discuss learnings with your mentor and Bloc Slack community. In addition, discuss with your mentor a strategy to read documentation more efficiently. This is a critically important skill to develop as software developer, as technologies keep evolving.

**A.**
My notes about React's documentation:

1. The latest React release is v16.6.0
2. Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps
3. Every React component implements a `render()` method that returns what to display.
4. Input data that is passed into the component can be accessed by `render()` via `this.props`.
5. A component can maintain internal state data accessed via `this.state`.
6. React's flexibility lets you interface with other libraries and frameworks.
7. In September 2018, **React Profiler** was introduced. This plugin is used to collect timing information about each component in order to identify performance bottlenecks in React applications.
8. In October 2018 **Create React App 2.0** was released. Some of its novelties are:
  - More styling options
  - Babel was updated to its 7th release
  - Addition of `PostCSS` to use new CSS features in old browsers
  - It is now possible to import a SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic) as a React component and use it in JSX
9. In the `Community` tab, one can fin tons of examples, courses, conferences, articles, videos and external resources. This is very valuable especially as a new developer.
10. Followed and completed its game tutorial (create a tic-tac-toe game practically from scratch). This provided me with a better understanding of React. The use of props and states for every component.


> Referring to the official documentation, build another simple React component from scratch similar to the one we built. Discuss your experience building the component from scratch with your mentor.
